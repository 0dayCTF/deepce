# Deepce
This folder containers some text files that will walk you through a some container escapes and exploits.

The `deepce.sh` shell script is located at `/opt/deepce/deepce.sh` and will be of use for performing these exploits. It is also avaliable directly as an alias using `deepce` in the shell.

To see all the test cases please see the scripts in `/opt/deepce/tests`, however the text files in this folder are more suited to learning about container exploits.

Message me if you find any bugs or have any questions.

Root password is crackable if you're into that kind of thing (can grab the hash using deepce.sh)
